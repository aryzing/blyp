# About the styles in this directory

Files `cards.css`, `new.css`, and `reset.css` are being used by `../cards.html` and `../sell.html`. Currently, no file in the main build uses these files.

Once their styles are mature, they will be gradually incorporated into the `index.css` and used in production.
